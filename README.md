# Full-Stack Blog App using MERN with Secure Auth & Media Upload

This is a full-stack blogging platform developed by **Maaz Ansari**, featuring secure user authentication, media upload support, and a dynamic frontend interface. Built using the powerful MERN stack — MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js — the project demonstrates modern web development practices including API handling, JWT-based security, image upload with Multer, and modular backend architecture.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Why It Was Used

- **MongoDB**: A flexible NoSQL database perfect for blog content, comments, and users.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight Node.js framework used to create clean RESTful APIs and handle middleware.
- **React.js**: Enables component-based frontend development with smooth routing and dynamic rendering.
- **Node.js**: Provides an asynchronous, event-driven runtime environment to power the server.
- **Multer**: Handles media file uploads (images) via `multipart/form-data`, storing them securely.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Implements secure, stateless user authentication for login and route protection.
- **bcryptjs**: Used for hashing user passwords securely before storing them in the database.
- **Axios**: For smooth client-to-server API communication.

## 🔐 Features

- Register and login functionality with JWT token handling
- Password hashing and secure credential storage
- Protected routes and user sessions
- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Upload blog cover images using Multer
- Clean, mobile-friendly UI with responsive design
