# Full-Stack Blog App using MERN with Secure Auth & Media Upload

This is a full-stack blog application built by **Maaz Ansari** using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It provides a secure platform where users can register, authenticate, write blog posts, and upload media files. The project focuses on clean architecture, secure practices, and user experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Why It Was Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database ideal for storing blog content with flexible schemas.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight and fast backend framework to define REST APIs cleanly.
- **React.js**: Used for its efficient state management and component-based UI.
- **Node.js**: Powers the backend and handles concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Multer**: Enables secure and efficient media (image) uploads to the server.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure, stateless user authentication.
- **bcryptjs**: Ensures password encryption before storing user data.
- **Axios**: Simplifies frontend API requests to the backend.

## 🔐 Features

- User registration and login system with hashed passwords
- JWT-based authentication for protected routes
- Upload and attach media files with blog posts
- Create, edit, delete, and fetch blogs dynamically
- Clean UI and modular code separation for scalability
